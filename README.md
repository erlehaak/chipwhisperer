# Power Analytic Attacks on CRYSTALS-Kyber

All code used in my master thesis is found in this repository, which is a fork of the ChipWhisperer repository.

## The attack

The Kyber implementation attacked is found in "hardware\victims\firmware\simpleserial-kyber512-m4"

The code for collecting power traces is found in "master\simpleserial-kyber512-m4.ipynb"

The code for performing the CPA attack is found in "master\CPA-Kyber512-m4-total.py"
